.
~~Strikeout~~
.
<p><del>Strikeout</del></p>
.


These are not strikeouts, you have to use exactly two "~~":
.
x ~~~foo~~~

x ~~foo~~~

x ~~~foo~~
.
<p>x ~~~foo~~~</p>
<p>x ~~foo~~~</p>
<p>x ~~~foo~~</p>
.

Strikeouts have the same priority as emphases:

.
**~~test**~~

~~**test~~**
.
<p><strong>~~test</strong>~~</p>
<p><del>**test</del>**</p>
.

Strikeouts have the same priority as emphases with respect to links:
.
[~~link]()~~

~~[link~~]()
.
<p><a href="">~~link</a>~~</p>
<p>~~<a href="">link~~</a></p>
.

Strikeouts have the same priority as emphases with respect to backticks:
.
~~`code~~`

`~~code`~~
.
<p>~~<code>code~~</code></p>
<p><code>~~code</code>~~</p>
.

Nested strikeouts:
.
~~foo ~~bar~~ baz~~

~~f **o ~~o b~~ a** r~~
.
<p><del>foo <del>bar</del> baz</del></p>
<p><del>f <strong>o <del>o b</del> a</strong> r</del></p>
.

Should not have a whitespace between text and "~~":
.
foo ~~ bar ~~ baz
.
<p>foo ~~ bar ~~ baz</p>
.
