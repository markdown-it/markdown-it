# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [14.0.0] - WIP
### Fixed
- Html tokens inside img alt are now rendered as their original text, #896.
- Hardbreaks inside img alt are now rendered as newlines.


## [13.0.2] - 2023-09-26
### Security
- Fixed crash/infinite loop caused by linkify inline rule, #957.

### Fixed
- Throw an error if 3rd party plugin doesn't increment `line` or `pos` counters
  (previously, markdown-it would likely go into infinite loop instead), #847.


## [13.0.1] - 2022-05-03
### Fixed
- Bumped `linkify-it` to 4.0.1. That should fix some hangs, caused by wrong
  data, returned from `linkify-it`.


## [13.0.0] - 2022-04-22
### Added
- Added a new token type `text_special` to store escaped characters, same as `text` but
  unaffected by replacement plugins (smartquotes, typographer, linkifier, etc.).
- Added a new rule `text_join` in `core` ruler. Text replacement plugins may choose to
  insert themselves before it.

### Changed
- `(p)` is no longer replaced with § by typographer (conflicts with ℗), #763.
- `text_collapse` rule is renamed to `fragments_join`.

### Fixed
- Smartquotes, typographic replacements and plain text links can now be escaped
  with backslash (e.g. `\(c)` or `google\.com` are no longer replaced).
- Fixed collision of emphasis and linkifier (so `http://example.org/foo._bar_-_baz`
  is now a single link, not emphasized). Emails and fuzzy links are not affected by this.

- Fix table/list parsing ambiguity, #767.


## [12.0.4] - 2020-12-20

## [12.0.0] - 2020-10-14
### Added

### Fixed

## [10.0.0] - 2019-09-11
### Security
- Fix quadratic parse time for some combinations of pairs, #583. Algorithm is
  now similar to one in reference implementation.

### Changed
- Minor internal structs change, to make pairs parse more effective (cost is
  linear now). If you use external "pairs" extensions, you need sync those with
  "official ones". Without update, old code will work, but can cause invalid
  result in rare case. This is the only reason of major version bump. With high probability you don't need to change your code, only update version dependency.
- Updated changelog format.
- Deps bump.

## [7.0.0] - 2016-06-22

  autodetected links by default. `md.linkifier.set('---', true)` will return old

## [6.0.3] - 2016-05-30
### Security
- Security fix: possible ReDOS in `linkify-it` (forced bump of `linkify-it` &
  `uc-micro` dependencies). New installs will use fixed packages automatically,
  but we bumped `markdown-it` version for sure & for web builds.


## [6.0.2] - 2016-05-16
